## Installation Guide 
> **Warning** 
>
> This installation guide is for my future self. Some steps might not be completed, updated or even tested. Proceed if you know what you are doing.

### Yay (AUR Helper)
This part is optional, you can use pacman or paru, I like yay.

```bash
pacman -S --needed git base-devel
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay.git
cd yay
makepkg -si
# delete yay files after the completion (optional) 
cd .. && rm -rf yay
```

### Hyprland and Dependencies
This installation is going to take a while depending on your system.

| Type | Package(s) |
|-|--|
| Hyprland + Wayland  | hyprland-git |
| QT Wayland Support | qt5-wayland qt6-wayland |
| Widgets | eww-git |
| Wallpaper | swww |
| XDG Desktop Portal  | xdg-desktop-portal-hyprland-git  |

```bash
yay -S hyprland-git qt5-wayland qt6-wayland eww-git swww xdg-desktop-portal-hyprland-git
```

Now execute Hyprland in tty with `Hyprland`, exit Hyprland by pressing `Super + SHIFT + Q` or open kitty with `Super + Return` 

### Packages 

| Type | Package(s)    |
|--------------- | --------------- |
| Audio | pamixer pavucontrol pipewire-pulse |

If you are interested in alternatives for some of these programs, you can go to [awesome-hyprland](https://github.com/hyprland-community/awesome-hyprland) list. 

```bash
yay -S exa feh ffmpegthumbnailer file-roller firefox gvfs kitty mpv newsboat nm-connection-editor noto-fonts-emoji pamixer pavucontrol pipewire-pulse polkit-kde-agent stow swaylock-effects thunar thunar-archive-plugin wlogout tldr unzip wl-clipboard wofi yt-dlp zsh 
```

### Zsh shell with Zap
I like using zsh with zap because it's simple and fast to setup everything.

```bash
# set zsh as default shell
chsh -s $(which zsh)

# restart terminal then use 
zsh <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zap-zsh/zap/master/install.zsh)
```

### Copying config with Stow
Stow is a nice way of creating symlinks (Symbolic Links) according to the tree of the target, so you can use stow to quickly copy any config.

```bash
# delete kitty and hypr autogenerated config (make sure to leave hyprland before doing this)
cd .config
rm -r hypr kitty

# make sure you are in home directory before cloning this repo
cd ~ 

git clone https://github.com/gasech/hyprland-dots.git
cd hyprland-dots 

# stows anything that is in a folder (ignores README.md)
stow */ 
```


### Downloading a Nerd Font
Nerd fonts allows you to have nice unicode icons and they look really nice, I personally use CascadiaCode:
```bash
mkdir -p $HOME/Downloads/nerdfonts/
cd $HOME/Downloads/
wget https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/download/v2.3.1/CascadiaCode.zip
unzip '*.zip' -d $HOME/Downloads/nerdfonts/
rm -rf *.zip
sudo cp -R $HOME/Downloads/nerdfonts/ /usr/share/fonts/
```

### GTK-XFCE Theme and Icons
You can use `nwg-look` and `xfce4-settings` to apply the theme and icons.

```bash
cd ~/Downloads
git clone https://github.com/Fausto-Korpsvart/Tokyo-Night-GTK-Theme.git

# Installs theme
sudo cp -r Tokyo-Night-GTK-Theme/themes/Tokyonight-Dark-BL-LB /usr/share/themes/

# Installs icons
sudo cp -r Tokyo-Night-GTK-Theme/icons/Tokyonight-Dark /usr/share/icons/

# Deletes folder
rm -r Tokyo-Night-GTK-Theme/
```
